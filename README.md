# FlockSquawk

FlockSquawk is a modular, event-driven ESP32 project for **passive RF awareness**. It listens to nearby WiFi and Bluetooth Low Energy activity, analyzes patterns against known signatures, and provides feedback through audio alerts, on-device displays, and structured telemetry.

## There is currently a critical bug in the 128x32 OLED variant. The Wi‑Fi packet parser is preventing all frames from being recognized. Problem: The subtype bits were extracted with 0x0F, but in 802.11 they’re in bits 4–7 of the first byte. That means the code always sees subtype 0, so it discarded every frame. 

## Patch: Change the mask to 0x00F0 so beacons/probes are correctly detected.

## What the Project Does

At runtime, FlockSquawk:

- Sniffs WiFi management frames using ESP32 promiscuous mode
- Scans nearby BLE advertisements using NimBLE
- Compares observations against signature patterns
  - SSIDs
  - MAC prefixes (OUIs)
  - BLE device names
  - Service UUIDs
- Emits structured JSON events over Serial
- Plays audible alerts via I2S audio
- Displays live status on an attached screen (variant dependent)

## Project Goals

- Educational: provide a readable, real-world RF + embedded systems codebase
- Experimental: make it easy to modify detection logic and behaviors
- Modular: allow different hardware front-ends (displays, controls, indicators)

## Display Variants

FlockSquawk supports multiple hardware front-ends. Each variant lives in its own folder and includes its **own dedicated README with wiring and setup instructions**.

Current variants:

- **Mini12864 (ST7567 LCD + Encoder)**  
  A full-featured UI with menus, rotary encoder input, RGB backlight support, and a rich visual interface.

- **128x32 I2C OLED (SSD1306/SH1106)**  
  A minimal, compact display option suitable for small builds and low-power setups.

Each variant is self-contained and can be opened directly in the Arduino IDE.

If you are trying to build the project, start by entering one of the variant folders and follow that README.

## Core Architecture

All variants share the same core subsystems:

- **RadioScannerManager**  
  Handles WiFi promiscuous mode and BLE scanning

- **ThreatAnalyzer**  
  Compares observed data against signature patterns

- **EventBus**  
  Lightweight publish/subscribe system connecting components

- **SoundEngine**  
  I2S-based WAV playback using LittleFS

- **TelemetryReporter**  
  Emits structured JSON output over Serial

Because of this structure, new interfaces can be added cleanly: displays, LEDs, network reporting, logging, etc.
